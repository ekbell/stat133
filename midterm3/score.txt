Function 1
0/5
Not completed

Function 2
3/5
The OR operator | does not quite work like that. Instead of 
    if(vec[i] == 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)
We have
    if(vec[i]==0 | vec[i]==1 | â€¦)

Function 3
4/5
> hisToTheir("he")
[1] "he"

Function 4
4/5
There are syntax errors on line 88 and 90; but the idea is OK.
